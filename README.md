## How to use this repository

The main file, Optimization_Main uses several supporting files. The supporting files are mainly in the background and do not need to be altered. The exception is ObjectiveFcn_Full which is the file describing the objective function. Here you can tune the weights of the objective function or change or add terms for different optimization goals.
