   abstract = {In order to verify the necessity and effectiveness of redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) of anthropomorphic manipulators, the effects of redundant DOFs on manipulator's kinematic characteristics are quantitatively studied. Firstly, the manipulator configurations with 6, 7 and 8 DOFs as well as optimal position and posture structure are introduced. Kinematic models of the three manipulators with the same maximum working radius, the same joint motion range are established. Workspace, Jacobian condition number and manipulability of the three manipulators are obtained respectively through numerical simulations, and their kinematic characteristics are analyzed from three aspects. Then, the distribution of relative manipulation capabilities in the workspaces and the optimal workspace of the three manipulators are obtained based on the concept of global relative manipulability. Through comparing and analysis, the effects of redundant DOFs on workspace, movement flexibility and manipulability of manipulators are obtained, which can provide theoretical basis for the configuration design of anthropomorphic manipulators.},
